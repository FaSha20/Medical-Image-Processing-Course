# 🧠 Medical Image Processing Course Projects

Welcome to the repository for my projects completed as part of the **Medical Image Processing** course. This collection showcases a range of classical and deep learning techniques applied to various medical imaging tasks—from segmentation to classification and image registration.

Each project is contained in its own folder with a detailed `README.md` and Jupyter notebook.
